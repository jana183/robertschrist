Ethics should not be decided by Dr. Evil.
Beyond do no harm to others, ethics becomes a complicated discussion.
For example, maybe someone has a fake id to use it to donate blood because they are a week younger than they need to be to be in the blood drive and their parents are in another state.
Probably not.  But maybe.
Also, the US federal government have many opinions on proper ethics for researchers.  Many opinions indeed.
