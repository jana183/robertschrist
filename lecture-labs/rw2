I believe that I properly got through all the SCHEMA steps... but am not sure how to delete/remove the schemas "augur_data" created accidentally under postgres the first try.
I am also afraid the "user augur" is under this postgres schema, and that is the reason I can't remove it or remake it.
Will this potentially present future difficulties?
